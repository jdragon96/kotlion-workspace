## Recipe App Compose Multiplatform

Inspired by [Roaa Kadam](https://github.com/Roaa94) flutter [app](https://github.com/Roaa94/recipes_ui_app/), I wanted to do the same in Compose Multiplatform. There is a lot to explore in Compose Multiplatform from the aspect of this app like Heor Animation, Collapsable Toolbar, Staggered Animations, Gyroscope detection etc. 

> **Note**
> It is still a work in progress
